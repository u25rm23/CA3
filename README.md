The website has a navigation bar for navigation which leads to the 3 files of the website, and also a jumbotron for the banner. 
The navigation bar stays at the top of the page so the user can easily navigate after scrolling through the page.
There are 2 columns for the layout, this was chosen for consistency across pages as the visit page was required to have columns.
The information and image for each experience on the visit page gets a row to stack the experiences and make it responsive.
On the visit page, the left column contains the experience information and the right column has images of the experiences with links.
The images also redirect to the website when clicked. The colour scheme was chosen to be dark blue. 
There were some challenges making the experience information line up with its image in the other column but this was solved by using the grid system.
